# An Exploration on Carbon Related Datasets
Building off of previous [study](https://github.com/kaicheng0824/carbon_aware_ev_charging) on average carbon emission and the application on EV charging, we are exploring the utilization of marginal CO2 to analyze the difference in carbon saving when applying the 2 different dataset.

## Datasets
- [California Self-Generation Incentive Program](http://sgipsignal.com/) 

## Play with Analysis
